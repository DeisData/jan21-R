January 11 and 14, 2021 from 9-11:30am ET
[Register for workshop](https://calendar.library.brandeis.edu/event/7297544)

This hands-on workshop is for beginning coders. No experience required.  Our goal is to get you coding!  
The best way to learn how to program is to do something useful, so this introduction to R is built around a common scientific task: data analysis.
This workshop follows the [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) curriculum and is taught by a trained instructor.

This workshop is not recorded.
